      <p> The purpose of the project was to take a video of the road from the perspective of<br>
         the car as the car is driving, and be able to compute and visualize the edges of the <br>
         road which the car is driving on. Important hardware considerations included the area, <br>
         memory, throughput, and computation speed of the FPGA. Important car interface <br>
         considerations includes the safety features such as how the car slows down when it sees <br>
         an object on the road. </p>

      <p> In the field of gesture recognition and image processing, finger tracking is a <br>
        high-resolution technique that is employed to know the consecutive position of the finger<br>
        or fingers of the user. Finger tracking is important for communication between humans and<br>
        computers to be more intuitive through hand gestures and movements. This kind of <br>
        technology can be expanded so that in the future, there might be technological devices <br>
        that can be controlled only through hand and body gestures. There are many ways to <br>
        implement finger/hand tracking, but in this project and for the sake of the class, <br>
        an optical motion capture system will be implemented through MATLAB.  </p>

    <p class="About-Body"> Hello, I am Jae Woo Ok, a Master's student currently studying Computer
      Engineering at Northwestern University. My focus and research have been
      mostly on Computer Architecture, FPGA, ASIC, VLSI projects, but I am also
      interested in software engineering as well. <br><br>

      In my free time, I enjoy playing League of Legends, dancing, or playing with my cat. <br><br>

      Feel free to reach out to me for buisness inquiries or to play a game of League!
