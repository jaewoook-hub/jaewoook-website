      <p> The goal of the Canny Edge Algorithm is to have a color image input and output <br>
        a black and white image of only the edges of the picture remaining. This algorithm <br>
        is useful for autonomous driving because once the edges of the image are found, the most <br>
        significant lines in the image (the edges of the road) can be detected using the Hough Transform. <br>
        The goal of the project was to take individual frames of the road from a video stream and output <br>
        images that detected the edges of the road. To test the functionality, an image of train tracks <br>
        were used for its similarity to road edges. </p>

    <img class="project-art" src="images/step5.jpg" alt="step5_Pic">
    <div class="project-description">
      <p> This is the output of the Canny Edge Algorithm. The Canny Edge Algorithm has 5 filters. The first<br>
         filter turns the color image into grayscale. Then the Gaussain filter blurs the image using a matrix <br>
         (5x5 in this implementation). Then, the Sobel filter calculates the gradients using a 3x3 matrix.<br>
         The 4th step is to fix the white lines so they are not as thick through non-maximum suppression. <br>
         Finally, Hysteresis will keep the pixel if the pixel exceeds the high threshold or if a pixel exceeds <br>
         the low threshold value and there is one adjacent pixel.</p>

    <p class="project1-name"> Hough Transform Output </p>
    <img class="project-art" src="images/step6.jpg" alt="step6_Pic">
    <div class="project-description">
      <p> This is the output of the Hough Transform. The Hough Transform has 4 steps. The first one is to use <br>
        an accumulator to determine the weights of the lines. The Accumulaton indicates all the lines on the image <br>
        and represents them in a polar coordinate system. For each pixel, there can be 180 different lines, so it <br>
        calculates the distance to the central pixel 180 times and adds 1 for the corresponding unit in accumulator.<br>
        The next step is to loop over accumulator to get all points whose value is higher than a certain “threshold”<br>
        value. Then, the finite lines component takes rho and theta value from threshold and converts into endpoints<br>
        of lines in rectangular coordinate system. Finally, the algorithm calculates points on the line and prints <br>
        a red pixel for every point </p>

      <p> The block diagram shows this process from the input image to the final output image. There is a FIFO in-between<br>
         every block so that each pixel can be pipelined for better performance.</p>
